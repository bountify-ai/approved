# approval.md hook shim for Hermes Agent (HOSTED-10, hardened in HOSTED-13).
#
# Hermes runs this as a `pre_tool_call` shell hook. It reads the Hermes
# envelope on stdin, POSTs it to the tenant's facade (`approval serve`,
# POST /hook/hermes), and replays the facade's answer: body.stdout to stdout,
# body.stderr to stderr, exit body.exit_code (core cli-reference, "The response
# contract"). The shim decides nothing; the facade runs the core decider.
#
# FAIL CLOSED. Any transport failure, non-200 status, or missing, unparseable
# or truncated body prints the native Hermes block directive and exits 2.
# The directive on STDOUT is load-bearing: hermes-agent 0.14.0 (the Maritime
# template, v2026.5.16) has no `fail_closed` and does not treat exit 2 as a
# block; it blocks only on a stdout directive. So the shim also refuses to
# pass through a non-zero exit whose stdout carries no block directive, or an
# exit-0 stdout that is not empty and not a JSON object.
#
# TWO WAYS TO RUN, chosen by whether the hook home exists:
#
#   /opt/approval/hook-home present (the gated Hermes image, hermes-image/):
#     the shim runs as its own user (`approvalhook`), started by the root-owned
#     launcher /opt/approval/hook-launcher with a fixed environment. HOME and
#     TMPDIR are the hook home (owned by this user, mode 0700), and the facade
#     URL and the agent credential come from hook-home/facade.env (owned by
#     this user, mode 0600), written by the image's supervisor. Nothing the
#     agent can write (its PATH, its HOME, its TMPDIR, its environment) reaches
#     this process. The home or the file with any other owner or mode blocks.
#
#   no hook home (a hook installed by hand on a harness machine, HOSTED-10):
#     the facade URL and the credential are read from the environment under
#     the names below. The process runs as the agent's own user there, which
#     no shim can defend against fully; the fixed PATH, the absolute tool
#     paths, `curl -q` and the scrubbed variables close what a shim can.
#
# Settings. In the image they come from facade.env (URL, TOKEN, ALLOW_HTTP,
# WAIT_S, MAX_TIME); by hand, from the environment:
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_URL_ENV    name of the variable holding the facade base URL
#                            (default HOSTED_DOGFOOD_FACADE_URL)
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_TOKEN_ENV  name of the variable holding the AGENT credential
#                            (default HOSTED_DOGFOOD_FACADE_AGENT_TOKEN)
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_LOG        log file (default /opt/data/approval-hook.log;
#                            in the image, hook-home/approval-hook.log)
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_MAX_TIME   curl --max-time seconds per request (default 25;
#                            keep it under Maritime's ~30 s public-proxy cut)
#   APPROVAL_HOOK_WAIT_S     total seconds to keep asking while the facade
#                            answers hook-timeout, or after the first post
#                            timed out (image default 280, at most 285; by
#                            hand default 0, one request only: set it only
#                            under an entry timeout above it, on a Hermes
#                            that honours fail_closed)
#   APPROVAL_FACADE_ALLOW_HTTP=1  accept an http:// facade URL (local fakes
#                            only); otherwise only https:// is accepted
#
# WAITING FOR A HUMAN. A facade reached through a public proxy must answer
# within the proxy's cut (about 30 s), far short of the time a human needs to
# see the question on a phone. So when the facade answers with a block naming
# `hook-timeout` (no decision yet; the question stays open and a retry of the
# same bytes adopts it), the shim waits 5 s and posts the same envelope again,
# until APPROVAL_HOOK_WAIT_S have passed since it started; then it replays the
# last block. An allow, or any other block, is replayed at once. With the
# image's 280 s the effective human window is about 280 s, inside Hermes's
# 300 s per-entry timeout.
#
# A FIRST POST THAT TIMED OUT (HOSTED-14). The facade's own hook wait must sit
# well under MAX_TIME (12 s for the 25 s default). When it does not, the first
# post can hit the ceiling (curl exit 28) after the facade has already opened
# the question, and a re-post of the same bytes adopts it. So a curl timeout
# on the FIRST post, after at least MAX_TIME, with WAIT_S above 0, enters the
# same loop a hook-timeout block does: re-post every 5 s until WAIT_S, then
# replay the facade's last block, or, when no facade answer ever arrived, block
# with the transport reason. Every other first-post failure (connection
# refused, TLS, DNS, non-200, an unparseable body) is final: nothing there
# says a question was opened. With WAIT_S=0 a first-post timeout is final too.
#
# The credential goes to curl through a config on stdin, never argv, so it
# does not appear in /proc/<pid>/cmdline. It travels as
# X-Approval-Authorization because Maritime's public proxy strips
# Authorization (image/README.md).
#
# The log carries a timestamp, the tool name, HTTP status, exit code, the
# curl exit code of a timed-out first post, elapsed ms, the attempt, the
# refusal code and a fixed reason only. Never an envelope, a body or a value.
